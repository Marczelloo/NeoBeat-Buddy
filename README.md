# Neo Beat Buddy

A feature-rich Discord music bot powered by Lavalink and Poru, with DJ mode, adaptive genre-aware smart autoplay, advanced statistics, interactive EQ mixer, and seamless playlist support.

## Features

- **Slash-only interface** for queueing, playback, and moderation safeguards.
- **Music source selection** — choose your preferred search source (Deezer, YouTube, or Spotify) per-server or per-query with position-independent autocomplete.
- **Deezer FLAC quality playback** — high-fidelity lossless audio as default source with automatic quality display.
- **Live autocomplete search** — get instant song suggestions as you type in `/play` command with source-aware results and Auto mode combining multiple sources.
- **Search history tracking** — automatic history of all your searches with replay, search, export to playlist, and clear functions.
- **Session queue export** — save entire listening sessions (history + queue) as playlists for easy replay.
- **Music Wrapped & Insights** — personal and server-wide listening statistics with top tracks, artists, listening patterns, streaks, and achievements.
- **Health monitoring** — comprehensive system metrics, error tracking, Lavalink status, performance monitoring, and admin diagnostics.
- **Enhanced logging** — structured JSON logs, automatic log rotation, error aggregation, performance metrics tracking, and emoji-based visual indicators for all operations with readable track metadata.
- **Adaptive smart autoplay** with priority-based recommendations — uses Deezer first, then Spotify, then YouTube as last resort. Maintains genre consistency, tempo flow, time-aware energy adjustments, mood progression, and context-aware artist diversity.
- **24/7 radio mode** — bot stays in voice channel permanently and plays music continuously like a radio station.
- **Interactive EQ mixer panel** with 15-band control, A/B comparison, custom preset saving (up to 10 per user), real-time visual feedback, and 10-minute inactivity auto-cleanup.
- **DJ mode** with role-based permissions, skip voting (dj/vote/hybrid modes), and track suggestion approval workflow.
- **Real-time statistics** per guild and globally via `/stats` — tracks songs played, listening hours, unique users, peak listeners, top sources, and hourly activity patterns.
- **Lyrics lookup** for the current track with `/lyrics` — live synced lyrics from Deezer with real-time updates and highlighted current line, fallback to LRC Library and Genius API.
- **Interactive queue management** with pagination, track removal by position or keyword, and shuffle.
- **Persistent state** — now playing messages, EQ configurations, DJ settings, guild stats, and autoplay preferences survive restarts.
- **Enhanced stability** — automatic voice region reconnection when Discord changes servers, improved duplicate prevention (tracks last 100 songs), and fixed fallback source playback.
- **Version announcements** — automatic patch notes delivered to servers when new versions are released, with `/changelog` to view any version and `/setup announcements` to configure channel and toggle notifications.
- **Age-restricted content handling** with automatic fallback to alternate sources.
- **Track history** with `/previous` command to replay or rewind.

  Queue a track from YouTube, Spotify, or a search query with **live autocomplete suggestions** as you type. Use `prepend:true` to add it to the front of the queue.  
  _In DJ mode, non-DJs submit suggestions for approval._

- **`/pause`** — Pause the currently playing track (DJ restricted in DJ mode).
- **`/resume`** — Resume a paused track (DJ restricted in DJ mode).
- **`/stop`** — Stop playback and clear the queue (DJ only while DJ mode is enabled).

- **`/seekto position:<seconds|mm:ss|hh:mm:ss>`** — Jump to a specific timestamp in the current track (DJ restricted in DJ mode).
- **`/volume level:<0-100>`** — Set the playback volume (DJ only in DJ mode).
- **`/lyrics [synced:true|false]`** — Display lyrics for the currently playing song. Use `synced:true` for live updating lyrics with highlighted current line (Deezer/LRC Library), or `synced:false` for full static lyrics. Player button defaults to synced.
- **`/autoplay enable:<true|false>`** — Toggle adaptive genre-aware smart autoplay mode (DJ only).
- **`/247`** — Toggle 24/7 radio mode — bot stays in voice and plays continuously (DJ only).

---

### 📜 Queue & Looping

- **`/queue view`** — View the current queue with pagination controls. Pending DJ suggestions appear when DJ mode is active.
- **`/queue export name:<playlist> [include-current:true]`** — Export current session (queue + history) to a playlist. Saves all tracks played in current session plus queued tracks.
- **`/remove [position:<number>] [title:<keyword>]`** — Remove a specific track from the queue by position or title search (DJ only in DJ mode).
- **`/clearqueue`** — Remove every track from the queue (DJ only while DJ mode is enabled).

### 🤖 Smart Autoplay (Genre-Aware + Adaptive)

**Autoplay automatically discovers and queues music when your queue is empty, maintaining genre consistency, tempo flow, and natural energy progression throughout your listening session.**

#### How It Works

1. **Analyzes your listening history** — Tracks the last 15 songs played to understand your music taste, genre preferences, tempo patterns, and mood trends.

2. **Priority-based recommendation sources** — Pulls suggestions with intelligent fallback:

   - **🥇 Deezer Recommendations (highest priority)** — Returns 25 high-quality recommendations based on the last track. Uses `dzrec:` endpoint for native recommendations.
   - **🥈 Spotify Recommendations (second priority)** — Enriched with genre, popularity, and audio features data via Spotify API. Searches via `spsearch:` for playable tracks.
   - **🥉 YouTube Mix (fallback)** — Related tracks from YouTube's radio feature. Only used when premium sources provide less than 5 candidates.
   - **📉 YouTube Search (last resort)** — Generic search fallback. Only triggered when all other sources fail.
   - **📉 Top Artist Search (absolute last resort)** — Songs from your most-played artists. Only when nothing else works.

3. **Genre consistency** — Maintains your music style:

   - Extracts genre information from Spotify API for each track (when available)
   - Tracks top genres across your listening session (e.g., "rock", "indie rock", "alternative")
   - **+30 point bonus** per matching genre in recommendations
   - **-25 point penalty** for tracks with no genre overlap when you have a strong genre profile
   - **-15 points** per genre you've skipped recently
   - Learns from your skips to avoid unwanted genres

4. **Advanced scoring system** — Ranks candidates using **12 intelligent factors**:

   - **Genre consistency** — Strongly favors tracks matching your recent genres (+30 per match)
   - **Tempo/BPM matching** — Maintains natural flow (+15 within 15 BPM, +8 within 30 BPM)
   - **Time-of-day awareness** — Adjusts energy for morning/afternoon/evening/night (+12 optimal, +6 acceptable)
   - **Popularity weighting** — Balances discovery vs. familiarity (+10 for 50-85 popularity, -5 for obscure, -3 for overplayed)
   - **Mood progression** — Continues or stabilizes valence (happiness) trends (+12 for trend continuation, +8 for stability)
   - **Energy arc management** — Builds, maintains, or winds down energy intentionally (+15 for trend, +10 for plateau)
   - **Artist familiarity** — How often you've played them (+5 per occurrence)
   - **Duration similarity** — Matches average song length (+10 within 20%, +5 within 40%)
   - **Source quality** — Deezer > YouTube Mix > Search (+35/+15/+10)
   - **Smart artist diversity** — Context-aware penalties that prioritize sonic cohesion over strict rotation
   - **Skip learning** — Downweights artists and genres you skip (-20/-15 per skip)
   - **Duplicate prevention** — Never plays the same song twice (-1000 penalty)

5. **Quality filtering** — Automatically rejects:
   - Non-music content (tutorials, poetry, spoken word)
   - Short clips (<30 seconds)
   - Videos with excessive hashtags or emojis
   - Known non-music channels

#### Genre Consistency Explained

**Before enhancement:**

```
Rock → Rock → Pop → Electronic → Hip-hop → ???
```

_Genre drifts significantly after 3-4 autoplay tracks_

**After enhancement:**

```
Rock → Indie Rock → Alternative Rock → Garage Rock → Rock Ballad
```

_Maintains genre consistency while introducing variety within the genre family_

**Example scoring:**

If you're listening to rock music:

- **"Seven Nation Army"** (genres: garage rock, alternative rock)

  - Base: 50 points
  - Deezer source: +35
  - Genre matches: +30 (garage rock) +30 (alternative rock)
  - Tempo match: +15 (within 15 BPM)
  - Energy arc: +15 (building)
  - Final: **~175 points** ✅

- **"Uptown Funk"** (genres: pop, funk)
  - Base: 50 points
  - Deezer source: +35
  - Genre drift penalty: -25 (no rock genres)
  - Tempo mismatch: -5 (too different)
  - Final: **~55 points** ❌

#### Advanced Features

**Tempo/BPM Consistency**

- Analyzes average tempo across your session
- Prefers tracks within 15 BPM (+15 points) or 30 BPM (+8 points)
- Creates natural rhythmic flow without jarring tempo changes
- Example: 128 BPM session → prefers 115-141 BPM range

**Time-of-Day Awareness**

- **Morning (6am-12pm)**: Moderate energy preference (0.6 factor)
- **Afternoon (12pm-6pm)**: High energy preference (0.75 factor)
- **Evening (6pm-10pm)**: Moderate energy preference (0.65 factor)
- **Night (10pm-6am)**: Low energy preference (0.4 factor)
- Automatically adjusts recommendations to match your daily rhythm

**Popularity Weighting**

- Sweet spot: 50-85 popularity (+10) — Popular but not overplayed
- Too obscure: <25 popularity (-5) — Harder to enjoy unfamiliar tracks
- Overplayed: >95 popularity (-3) — Avoids radio fatigue
- Balances discovery with accessibility

**Mood Progression**

- Detects valence (happiness) trend from last 5 tracks
- Continues upward mood trajectory (+12) — Building positive energy
- Continues downward trajectory (+12) — Deepening introspection
- Maintains stable mood (+8) — Consistent emotional tone
- Creates intentional emotional arcs

**Energy Arc Management**

- Detects energy trend: increasing/decreasing/stable
- Continues energy build-up (+15) — Escalating intensity
- Continues wind-down (+15) — Relaxing progression
- Maintains plateau (+10) — Sustained energy level
- Prevents abrupt energy shifts that break flow

#### Audio Feature Targeting

The algorithm uses Deezer recommendations to maintain consistency, with optional Spotify metadata enrichment for tempo and energy analysis when credentials are configured.

#### Smart Artist Diversity (Context-Aware)

Unlike simple artist rotation, the new diversity system **prioritizes sonic cohesion** while preventing monotony:

**"Vibe Match" Scoring:**

- Calculates how well a track matches your session on 4 factors:
  - **Genre** (25 points) — Shares genres with listening history?
  - **Tempo** (25 points) — BPM within 20-40 of average?
  - **Energy** (25 points) — Energy level aligns?
  - **Mood** (25 points) — Valence (happiness) matches?
- Combined into a 0-100 "vibe match score"

**Three-Tier Penalty System:**

1. **Last Track (Consecutive):** -40 penalty (prevents back-to-back plays of same artist)
2. **Last 3 Tracks (Recent):**
   - Vibe ≥80%: -8 penalty (allows if excellent match)
   - Vibe ≥60%: -18 penalty (moderate restriction)
   - Vibe <60%: -30 penalty (heavy restriction)
3. **Top 3 Artists Overall (Not in Last 3):**
   - Vibe ≥80%: -5 penalty ✅ (very lenient — prioritizes genre/tempo/energy match)
   - Vibe ≥60%: -12 penalty (reasonable)
   - Vibe 40-60%: -20 penalty (discouraged)
   - Vibe <40%: -30 penalty (heavily discouraged)
   - Extra -10 if it's the #1 most frequent artist

**What This Achieves:**

- ✅ Same artist CAN play if genre/tempo/energy/mood match excellently
- ✅ Prevents monotony — won't play same artist back-to-back
- ✅ Balanced diversity — encourages variety but prioritizes vibe consistency
- ✅ Genre-focused — if you're in a hip-hop session, it'll stick to hip-hop even if same artist

**Example:**

If you're listening to rock:

- **"Smells Like Teen Spirit"** (Nirvana) → plays
- Next autoplay finds **another Nirvana track**:
  - Vibe match: 85% (genre + tempo + energy all match)
  - Penalty: Only -5 (allowed because vibe is excellent)
  - ✅ Will likely play if it scores high on other factors
- But if autoplay tries to queue Nirvana **again** right after:
  - Penalty: -40 (consecutive play prevention)
  - ❌ Won't play even with perfect vibe match

#### Usage

```bash
# Enable autoplay (DJ permission required)
/autoplay

# Autoplay status shows in the now-playing message
```

**When enabled**, autoplay triggers automatically when the queue ends, seamlessly continuing your listening session with curated recommendations that match your genre preferences, tempo flow, mood, and energy levels.

**Note:** Deezer credentials are required for the best autoplay experience with genre consistency. Without Deezer, the bot falls back to YouTube Mix recommendations (no genre awareness). Spotify credentials are optional but recommended — they provide rich metadata (genres, audio features, popularity) for better scoring, but playback will still work without them.

### 📻 24/7 Radio Mode

**Turn your bot into a 24/7 radio station** that stays in voice and plays music continuously.

#### How It Works

1. **Enable 24/7 mode:**

   ```
   /247
   ```

2. **What happens:**

   - Bot stays in voice channel permanently (even when alone)
   - Automatically queues tracks when queue ends (uses smart autoplay algorithm)
   - Ignores inactivity timers
   - Continues playing based on listening history

3. **Requirements:**

   - Bot must be in voice with at least one track played
   - Needs listening history to generate recommendations
   - DJ permission required

4. **Disable:**
   - Use `/247` again to toggle off
   - Or use `/stop` to stop music and disable 24/7 mode

#### Use Cases

- **Community servers**: Background music running 24/7
- **Study/work servers**: Continuous lo-fi or ambient music
- **Music-focused servers**: Non-stop radio experience

**Note:** 24/7 state is NOT saved across restarts to prevent auto-join issues on startup.

## Technical Deep Dives

### Smart Autoplay Architecture

#### Session Profiling

- Analyzes last 15 tracks for artist frequency, genre distribution, and average duration
- Extracts genre information from Spotify API (e.g., "indie rock", "alternative rock")
- Calculates average audio features (energy, danceability, valence, acousticness, tempo)
- Detects energy and mood (valence) trends: increasing, decreasing, or stable
- Calculates average release year and tempo (BPM)
- Builds a comprehensive listening profile used for scoring candidates

#### Multi-Source Candidate Collection (Priority Order)

The autoplay system now uses a strict priority order, only falling back to lower-priority sources when higher-priority sources fail or provide insufficient results (less than 5 candidates):

1. **🥇 Deezer Recommendations** (highest priority, +40 score bonus)

   - Uses Deezer's `dzrec:{trackId}` endpoint for native recommendations
   - Returns up to 25 high-quality recommendations with full metadata
   - Fast and reliable - no additional API calls needed
   - Provides artist, title, duration, and track identifiers
   - **Always attempted first**

2. **🥈 Spotify Recommendations** (second priority, +35 score bonus)

   - Uses Spotify's `/recommendations` API based on seed track
   - Enriched with genre, popularity, audio features (tempo, energy, valence)
   - Resolves tracks via Lavalink's `spsearch:` for playback
   - **Always attempted after Deezer to add variety and metadata**

3. **🥉 YouTube Mix** (fallback, +15 score bonus)

   - Uses YouTube's radio playlist feature
   - Provides up to 20 related tracks
   - No genre/tempo/mood information available
   - **Only used when Deezer + Spotify provide < 5 candidates**

4. **📉 YouTube Search** (last resort, +10 score bonus)
<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
>>>>>>> b1adc1d599ff252d5b2c968ebb9ffa2ae4241601
   - Generic YouTube search as fallback
   - **Only triggered when YouTube Mix also fails**

5. **📉 Top Artist Search** (absolute last resort, +8 score bonus)
   - Searches for songs by your most-played artists
   - **Only used when all other sources return nothing**

#### 12-Factor Scoring System

Each candidate receives a score based on:

<<<<<<< HEAD
| Factor                 | Points                     | Description                                                                 |

#### Time-of-Day Energy Factors

| Time Period          | Energy Factor | Preference      |
| -------------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Morning (6am-12pm)   | 0.6           | Moderate energy |
| Afternoon (12pm-6pm) | 0.75          | High energy     |
| Evening (6pm-10pm)   | 0.65          | Moderate energy |
| Night (10pm-6am)     | 0.4           | Low energy      |

#### Trend Detection

**Energy Trend** (last 5 tracks):

- Calculates average energy of first half vs. second half
- **Increasing**: Difference > 0.1 → Prefers higher energy
- **Decreasing**: Difference < -0.1 → Prefers lower energy
- **Stable**: Difference between -0.1 and 0.1 → Maintains current level

**Mood Trend (Valence)** (last 5 tracks):

- Calculates average valence of first half vs. second half
- **Increasing**: Difference > 0.1 → Prefers happier/more positive tracks
- **Decreasing**: Difference < -0.1 → Prefers mellower/introspective tracks
- **Stable**: Difference between -0.1 and 0.1 → Maintains current mood

#### Caching & Performance

- **Genre cache**: Stores genre information for tracks to avoid redundant API calls
- **Audio features cache**: Maps YouTube identifier → {genres, features, releaseYear}
- **Session tracking**: Monitors session start time for long-session adjustments
- **Skip history**: 30-minute memory window with genre tracking
- Persists in memory during bot runtime (cleared on restart)

#### Data Persistence

- **Autoplay state**: Stored in `helpers/data/guildState.json` per guild
- **Playback history**: Last 20 tracks in memory (used for profiling)
- **Skip patterns**: In-memory Map with 30-minute expiry, includes genres
- **Genre cache**: In-memory Map (cleared on restart)
- **Session start time**: In-memory Map for long-session detection

#### Detailed Logging

Enhanced logging provides full transparency:

- Top candidate with complete scoring breakdown
- Tempo, energy, genres, popularity for winner
- Individual scoring factors with point values
- Energy/mood trends and time-of-day adjustments
- Session profile summary (top genres, avg tempo, avg year, trends)

Example log output:

```
Session profile built: tracks=15, topGenres=rock(5), indie rock(4), alternative(3),
avgTempo=128BPM, avgYear=2015, energyTrend=increasing, timeOfDay=afternoon

Top candidates scored: winner=Arctic Monkeys - Do I Wanna Know? (167)
scoring=source:+30, genre:+60, tempo:+15, energyArc:+15, timeOfDay:+12,
popularity:+10, diversity:+20, artist:+5
```

### Testing

Run the autoplay test suite:

```bash
pnpm test:autoplay
```

Tests cover session profiling, genre scoring, tempo matching, duplicate detection, artist weight calculation, and edge cases.

## DJ Mode Overview

**DJ mode** restricts playback controls to users with a designated DJ role. Regular users can submit track suggestions that require DJ approval.

### Configuration

1. **Enable DJ mode:**

   ```
   /dj enable role:@DJ skipmode:hybrid threshold:50
   ```

2. **How it works:**

   - Users with the DJ role have full control
   - Non-DJs use `/play` to submit suggestions (appear in `/queue`)
   - DJ can approve/reject suggestions via buttons
   - Skip behavior depends on skip mode:
     - **dj**: Only DJ can skip
     - **vote**: Vote-based skip (50% threshold by default)
     - **hybrid**: Voting system, but DJ can override instantly

3. **Strict mode:**
   - `strict:true`: Only DJ role can manage DJ settings
   - `strict:false`: Server admins can also configure DJ mode

## Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't come online

- Check Docker logs: `docker compose logs -f bot`
- Verify `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `CLIENT_ID` in `.env.prod`
- Ensure bot has been invited with `applications.commands` scope

### Slash commands don't appear

- Run `pnpm deploy:prod` to register commands
- Wait up to 1 hour for global commands to propagate
- For instant updates, use guild-specific deployment

### Lavalink connection fails

- Check Lavalink logs: `docker compose logs -f lavalink`
- Verify `LAVALINK_HOST=lavalink` in `.env.prod` (for Docker)
- Ensure health check passes: `docker compose ps`

### Music playback issues

- Verify Lavalink is healthy and connected
- Check for age-restricted content (requires YouTube tokens)
- Review bot logs for fallback attempts
- Ensure Spotify credentials are configured for best autoplay results
- Check Lavalink node status and logs if playback fails

## 🔧 Reliability & Stability

### Voice Region Reconnection

When Discord changes the voice channel region (moving to a different voice server), the bot automatically:

- Detects the region change via `channelUpdate` event
- Saves complete playback state (track, position, queue, volume, loop mode)
- Destroys old connection and creates a fresh one to the new region
- Restores all settings and resumes playback from the exact position
- **No interruption** to the listening experience

## Troubleshooting

### Autoplay not working or genre drifting

- Ensure `/autoplay` is enabled (check now-playing message)
- **Verify Deezer credentials** in `.env` — `DEEZER_ARL_TOKEN` and `DEEZER_MASTER_KEY` required for recommendations
- Check logs for "Starting smart autoplay" and "Collected Deezer recommendations" messages
- Autoplay only triggers when queue is completely empty
- Without Deezer: Falls back to YouTube Mix (may drift genres)
- Check Lavalink logs for Deezer authentication errors

### EQ or custom presets not saving

- Check for "Failed to save" errors in logs
- Ensure `helpers/data/` directory exists and is writable
- Verify no BigInt serialization errors (fixed in latest version)
- Check Docker volume mounts if using containers

### Data not persisting

- Ensure volume mounts in `docker-compose.yml`:
  ```yaml
  volumes:
    - ./helpers/data:/app/helpers/data
    - ./logs:/app/logs
  ```
- Check file permissions on host
