# Neo Beat Buddy

A feature-rich Discord music bot powered by Lavalink and Poru, with DJ mode, advanced statistics, persistent EQ settings, and seamless playlist support.

## Features

- **Slash-only interface** for queueing, playback, and moderation safeguards.
- **DJ mode** with role-based permissions, skip voting (dj/vote/hybrid modes), and track suggestion approval workflow.
- **Real-time statistics** per guild and globally via `/stats` — tracks songs played, listening hours, unique users, peak listeners, top sources, and hourly activity patterns.
- **Lyrics lookup** for the current track with `/lyrics` (powered by Genius API).
- **Interactive queue management** with pagination, track removal by position or keyword, and shuffle.
- **Live equalizer** with presets (bass, nightcore, lofi, etc.) and per-band fine-tuning — settings persist across bot restarts.
- **Persistent state** — now playing messages, EQ configurations, DJ settings, and guild stats survive restarts.
- **Age-restricted content handling** with automatic fallback to alternate sources.
- **Track history** with `/previous` command to replay or rewind.
- **Docker-based production stack** with health checks and auto-restart policies.
- **pnpm-first workflow** for fast, efficient dependency management.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** 20+ and **pnpm** 10+
- **Docker** & **Docker Compose** (for hosting Lavalink or the full stack)
- **Lavalink** 4.x credentials (see `.env-example`)
- **Genius API key** (optional, for lyrics)
- **Spotify credentials** (optional, for Spotify playback)

## Quick Start

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Copy environment template and configure
cp .env-example .env.dev
# Edit .env.dev with your Discord token, Lavalink host (127.0.0.1), and API keys

# Start Lavalink locally
pnpm lavalink:dev

# Run the bot in development mode
pnpm start:dev
```

Deploy slash commands to your test guild:

```bash
pnpm deploy:dev
```

## DJ Mode Overview

**DJ mode** restricts playback controls to users with a designated DJ role. Regular users can submit track suggestions that require DJ approval.

### Configuration

1. **Enable DJ mode:**
   ```
   /dj enable role:@DJ skipmode:hybrid threshold:50
   ```

2. **How it works:**
   - Users with the DJ role have full control
   - Non-DJs use `/play` to submit suggestions (appear in `/queue`)
   - DJ can approve/reject suggestions via buttons
   - Skip behavior depends on skip mode:
     - **dj**: Only DJ can skip
     - **vote**: Vote-based skip (50% threshold by default)
     - **hybrid**: Voting system, but DJ can override instantly

3. **Strict mode:**
   - `strict:true`: Only DJ role can manage DJ settings
   - `strict:false`: Server admins can also configure DJ mode

---

## Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't come online
- Check Docker logs: `docker compose logs -f bot`
- Verify `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `CLIENT_ID` in `.env.prod`
- Ensure bot has been invited with `applications.commands` scope

### Slash commands don't appear
- Run `pnpm deploy:prod` to register commands
- Wait up to 1 hour for global commands to propagate
- For instant updates, use guild-specific deployment

### Lavalink connection fails
- Check Lavalink logs: `docker compose logs -f lavalink`
- Verify `LAVALINK_HOST=lavalink` in `.env.prod` (for Docker)
- Ensure health check passes: `docker compose ps`

### Music playback issues
- Verify Lavalink is healthy and connected
- Check for age-restricted content (requires YouTube tokens)
- Review bot logs for fallback attempts

### Data not persisting
- Ensure volume mounts in `docker-compose.yml`:
  ```yaml
  volumes:
    - ./helpers/data:/app/helpers/data
    - ./logs:/app/logs
  ```
- Check file permissions on host
