# MewBit

**A self-hosted Discord music bot with a shared player that opens inside the voice channel.**

Multi-source search across Deezer, Spotify, SoundCloud and YouTube. FLAC playback, DJ
controls, a fifteen-band equalizer, synced lyrics and playlists — on your own hardware, with
no tier that takes any of it away.

Three surfaces, one state: a **Discord Activity** everyone in the channel shares, a **player
embed** in the text channel for people who do not open it, and a **web dashboard** for the
people who run the server.

> **Keep secrets out of Git.** Start from [`.env-example`](.env-example) and keep your real
> `.env*` files on the machine that runs the bot. Tokens, cookies, API keys and the Discord
> client secret never belong in a commit.

## What it does

**Playback.** Lavalink v4 in a voice channel, with Deezer, Spotify, SoundCloud and YouTube
searched together and direct provider URLs accepted. FLAC through Deezer. Cross-provider
loudness compensation, a configurable default source per server or per user, and recovery
snapshots that survive an unexpected disconnect — restored when someone starts playback
again, never by silently rejoining a channel the bot was removed from.

**Autoplay.** An optional AI DJ plans the next transitions, and every proposal is verified
against a real, playable provider entry before it can be queued. Behind it, the V3 selector
scores a small trusted pool on musical fit — artist relation, album, similarity, session
memory — rather than provider order, and caps same-artist and same-album runs so one act
cannot take over the room. Autoplay picks stay marked in the queue.

**The Activity.** A shared visual player in the voice channel: the same queue, artwork and
transport for everyone, with search, playlists, synced lyrics, thirteen effects and the
equalizer. There is no host who sees more than the rest.

**Running a server.** DJ roles and vote-to-skip, player and announcement channels, per-server
logging, tickets, moderation commands, custom embeds, health metrics and listening
statistics — configurable from Discord or from the dashboard.

## Commands

Every command is documented by the running instance itself, so the list is never a stale
copy:

- **In Discord** — `/help` browses all 78 commands by category.
- **On the web** — the **Commands** page of your deployment's site, with search across every
  category. It reads the same source `/help` does.

## Requirements

- Node.js **20 or newer**
- pnpm **10 or newer**
- Docker and Docker Compose (recommended for Lavalink and production)
- A Discord application and bot token
- A Discord server where you can manage the bot and slash commands

For the full experience, configure at least YouTube credentials and a Last.fm API key.
Spotify, Deezer, Genius and SoundCloud access are optional but improve provider coverage and
metadata.

## Quick start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --dir activity install
```

Copy the example environment and fill in the required values. For a local Lavalink container,
keep `LAVALINK_HOST=127.0.0.1`.

```bash
cp .env-example .env.dev
```

On PowerShell: `Copy-Item .env-example .env.dev`

```bash
pnpm lavalink:dev    # start Lavalink
pnpm deploy:dev      # register slash commands
pnpm start:dev       # start the bot
```

The bot is ready when it logs in to Discord and connects to Lavalink. Join a voice channel and
run `/play`. Re-run `pnpm deploy:dev` whenever a slash command's name, options or description
change.

Which values are required, and what every optional one does, is in
[Configuration](docs/configuration.md).

## Running it for real

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

The stack brings up the bot, a Lavalink node and a private `yt-cipher` service together, and
persists bot data in `helpers/data` and file logs in `logs` — back both up before rebuilding a
host. The full sequence, including the pinned YouTube source patch, is in
[Deployment](docs/deployment.md).
