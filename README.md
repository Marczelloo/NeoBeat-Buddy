### ü§ñ Smart Autoplay (Genre-Aware + Adaptive)

**Autoplay automatically discovers and queues music when your queue is empty, maintaining genre consistency, tempo flow, and natural energy progression throughout your listening session.**

#### How It Works

1. **Analyzes your listening history** ‚Äî Tracks the last 15 songs played to understand your music taste, genre preferences, tempo patterns, and mood trends.

2. **Multi-source recommendations** ‚Äî Pulls suggestions from:

   - **Spotify** ‚Äî Genre-aware recommendations using Spotify's algorithm with audio feature targeting (tempo, energy, valence, acousticness)
   - **YouTube Mix** ‚Äî Related tracks from YouTube's radio feature (fallback/supplement)
   - **Top artist search** ‚Äî Songs from your most-played artists

3. **Genre consistency** ‚Äî Maintains your music style:

   - Extracts genre information from Spotify API for each track
   - Tracks top genres across your listening session (e.g., "rock", "indie rock", "alternative")
   - **+30 point bonus** per matching genre in recommendations
   - **-25 point penalty** for tracks with no genre overlap when you have a strong genre profile
   - **-15 points** per genre you've skipped recently
   - Learns from your skips to avoid unwanted genres

4. **Advanced scoring system** ‚Äî Ranks candidates using **12 intelligent factors**:

   - **Genre consistency** ‚Äî Strongly favors tracks matching your recent genres (+30 per match)
   - **Tempo/BPM matching** ‚Äî Maintains natural flow (+15 within 15 BPM, +8 within 30 BPM)
   - **Time-of-day awareness** ‚Äî Adjusts energy for morning/afternoon/evening/night (+12 optimal, +6 acceptable)
   - **Popularity weighting** ‚Äî Balances discovery vs. familiarity (+10 for 50-85 popularity, -5 for obscure, -3 for overplayed)
   - **Mood progression** ‚Äî Continues or stabilizes valence (happiness) trends (+12 for trend continuation, +8 for stability)
   - **Energy arc management** ‚Äî Builds, maintains, or winds down energy intentionally (+15 for trend, +10 for plateau)
   - **Artist familiarity** ‚Äî How often you've played them (+5 per occurrence)
   - **Duration similarity** ‚Äî Matches average song length (+10 within 20%, +5 within 40%)
   - **Source quality** ‚Äî Spotify > YouTube Mix > Search (+30/+15/+10)
   - **Smart artist diversity** ‚Äî Context-aware penalties that prioritize sonic cohesion over strict rotation
   - **Skip learning** ‚Äî Downweights artists and genres you skip (-20/-15 per skip)
   - **Duplicate prevention** ‚Äî Never plays the same song twice (-1000 penalty)

5. **Quality filtering** ‚Äî Automatically rejects:
   - Non-music content (tutorials, poetry, spoken word)
   - Short clips (<30 seconds)
   - Videos with excessive hashtags or emojis
   - Known non-music channels

#### Genre Consistency Explained

**Before enhancement:**

```
Rock ‚Üí Rock ‚Üí Pop ‚Üí Electronic ‚Üí Hip-hop ‚Üí ???
```

_Genre drifts significantly after 3-4 autoplay tracks_

**After enhancement:**

```
Rock ‚Üí Indie Rock ‚Üí Alternative Rock ‚Üí Garage Rock ‚Üí Rock Ballad
```

_Maintains genre consistency while introducing variety within the genre family_

**Example scoring:**

If you're listening to rock music:

- **"Seven Nation Army"** (genres: garage rock, alternative rock)

  - Base: 50 points
  - Spotify source: +30
  - Genre matches: +30 (garage rock) +30 (alternative rock)
  - Tempo match: +15 (within 15 BPM)
  - Energy arc: +15 (building)
  - Final: **~170 points** ‚úÖ

- **"Uptown Funk"** (genres: pop, funk)
  - Base: 50 points
  - Spotify source: +30
  - Genre drift penalty: -25 (no rock genres)
  - Tempo mismatch: -5 (too different)
  - Final: **~50 points** ‚ùå

#### Advanced Features

**Tempo/BPM Consistency**

- Analyzes average tempo across your session
- Prefers tracks within 15 BPM (+15 points) or 30 BPM (+8 points)
- Creates natural rhythmic flow without jarring tempo changes
- Example: 128 BPM session ‚Üí prefers 115-141 BPM range

**Time-of-Day Awareness**

- **Morning (6am-12pm)**: Moderate energy preference (0.6 factor)
- **Afternoon (12pm-6pm)**: High energy preference (0.75 factor)
- **Evening (6pm-10pm)**: Moderate energy preference (0.65 factor)
- **Night (10pm-6am)**: Low energy preference (0.4 factor)
- Automatically adjusts recommendations to match your daily rhythm

**Popularity Weighting**

- Sweet spot: 50-85 popularity (+10) ‚Äî Popular but not overplayed
- Too obscure: <25 popularity (-5) ‚Äî Harder to enjoy unfamiliar tracks
- Overplayed: >95 popularity (-3) ‚Äî Avoids radio fatigue
- Balances discovery with accessibility

**Mood Progression**

- Detects valence (happiness) trend from last 5 tracks
- Continues upward mood trajectory (+12) ‚Äî Building positive energy
- Continues downward trajectory (+12) ‚Äî Deepening introspection
- Maintains stable mood (+8) ‚Äî Consistent emotional tone
- Creates intentional emotional arcs

**Energy Arc Management**

- Detects energy trend: increasing/decreasing/stable
- Continues energy build-up (+15) ‚Äî Escalating intensity
- Continues wind-down (+15) ‚Äî Relaxing progression
- Maintains plateau (+10) ‚Äî Sustained energy level
- Prevents abrupt energy shifts that break flow

#### Audio Feature Targeting

The algorithm uses audio features from Spotify to maintain consistency:

- **Energy** ‚Äî Intensity and activity level (0.0-1.0)
- **Danceability** ‚Äî Rhythm suitability for dancing (0.0-1.0)
- **Valence** ‚Äî Musical positivity/happiness (0.0-1.0)
- **Tempo** ‚Äî Beats per minute (BPM)
- **Acousticness** ‚Äî Acoustic vs. electronic sound (0.0-1.0)

These features are averaged across your session and used as target parameters for Spotify recommendations.

#### Smart Artist Diversity (Context-Aware)

Unlike simple artist rotation, the new diversity system **prioritizes sonic cohesion** while preventing monotony:

**"Vibe Match" Scoring:**

- Calculates how well a track matches your session on 4 factors:
  - **Genre** (25 points) ‚Äî Shares genres with listening history?
  - **Tempo** (25 points) ‚Äî BPM within 20-40 of average?
  - **Energy** (25 points) ‚Äî Energy level aligns?
  - **Mood** (25 points) ‚Äî Valence (happiness) matches?
- Combined into a 0-100 "vibe match score"

**Three-Tier Penalty System:**

1. **Last Track (Consecutive):** -40 penalty (prevents back-to-back plays of same artist)
2. **Last 3 Tracks (Recent):**
   - Vibe ‚â•80%: -8 penalty (allows if excellent match)
   - Vibe ‚â•60%: -18 penalty (moderate restriction)
   - Vibe <60%: -30 penalty (heavy restriction)
3. **Top 3 Artists Overall (Not in Last 3):**
   - Vibe ‚â•80%: -5 penalty ‚úÖ (very lenient ‚Äî prioritizes genre/tempo/energy match)
   - Vibe ‚â•60%: -12 penalty (reasonable)
   - Vibe 40-60%: -20 penalty (discouraged)
   - Vibe <40%: -30 penalty (heavily discouraged)
   - Extra -10 if it's the #1 most frequent artist

**What This Achieves:**

- ‚úÖ Same artist CAN play if genre/tempo/energy/mood match excellently
- ‚úÖ Prevents monotony ‚Äî won't play same artist back-to-back
- ‚úÖ Balanced diversity ‚Äî encourages variety but prioritizes vibe consistency
- ‚úÖ Genre-focused ‚Äî if you're in a hip-hop session, it'll stick to hip-hop even if same artist

**Example:**

If you're listening to rock:

- **"Smells Like Teen Spirit"** (Nirvana) ‚Üí plays
- Next autoplay finds **another Nirvana track**:
  - Vibe match: 85% (genre + tempo + energy all match)
  - Penalty: Only -5 (allowed because vibe is excellent)
  - ‚úÖ Will likely play if it scores high on other factors
- But if autoplay tries to queue Nirvana **again** right after:
  - Penalty: -40 (consecutive play prevention)
  - ‚ùå Won't play even with perfect vibe match

#### Usage

```bash
# Enable autoplay (DJ permission required)
/autoplay

# Autoplay status shows in the now-playing message
```

**When enabled**, autoplay triggers automatically when the queue ends, seamlessly continuing your listening session with curated recommendations that match your genre preferences, tempo flow, mood, and energy levels.

**Note:** Spotify credentials are highly recommended for the best autoplay experience with genre consistency and advanced features. Without Spotify, the bot falls back to YouTube Mix recommendations (no genre/tempo/mood awareness).

---

### üìª 24/7 Radio Mode

**Turn your bot into a 24/7 radio station** that stays in voice and plays music continuously.

#### How It Works

1. **Enable 24/7 mode:**

   ```
   /247
   ```

2. **What happens:**

   - Bot stays in voice channel permanently (even when alone)
   - Automatically queues tracks when queue ends (uses smart autoplay algorithm)
   - Ignores inactivity timers
   - Continues playing based on listening history

3. **Requirements:**

   - Bot must be in voice with at least one track played
   - Needs listening history to generate recommendations
   - DJ permission required

4. **Disable:**
   - Use `/247` again to toggle off
   - Or use `/stop` to stop music and disable 24/7 mode

#### Use Cases

- **Community servers**: Background music running 24/7
- **Study/work servers**: Continuous lo-fi or ambient music
- **Music-focused servers**: Non-stop radio experience

**Note:** 24/7 state is NOT saved across restarts to prevent auto-join issues on startup.

---

### üéõÔ∏è DJ Mode

- **`/dj enable [role:<role>] [skipmode:<mode>] [threshold:<10-100>]`**  
  Enable DJ mode. Optionally specify a DJ role (or let the bot create one), skip mode (`dj`, `vote`, or `hybrid`), and vote threshold percentage.

  - `dj`: Only DJ can skip
  - `vote`: Vote-based skip with threshold
  - `hybrid`: Vote unless DJ overrides

- **`/dj permissions strict:<true|false>`**  
  Toggle strict permissions:

  - `true`: Only DJ role can manage DJ settings
  - `false`: Server managers can also configure DJ mode

- **`/dj status`** ‚Äî Show current DJ configuration (role, skip mode, vote threshold, strict mode).

## Technical Deep Dives

### Smart Autoplay Architecture

#### Session Profiling

- Analyzes last 15 tracks for artist frequency, genre distribution, and average duration
- Extracts genre information from Spotify API (e.g., "indie rock", "alternative rock")
- Calculates average audio features (energy, danceability, valence, acousticness, tempo)
- Detects energy and mood (valence) trends: increasing, decreasing, or stable
- Calculates average release year and tempo (BPM)
- Builds a comprehensive listening profile used for scoring candidates

#### Multi-Source Candidate Collection

1. **Spotify Recommendations** (primary, if credentials available)

   - Uses seed track + genre seeds + audio feature targets (including tempo)
   - Returns 15 genre-matched candidates with full metadata
   - Each candidate includes: genres, popularity, release year, audio features (tempo, energy, valence, etc.)

2. **YouTube Mix** (fallback/supplement)

   - Uses YouTube's radio playlist feature
   - Provides 20 related tracks
   - No genre/tempo/mood information available

3. **Top Artist Search** (supplement)
   - Searches for songs by your most-played artists
   - Only used when strong genre profile exists

#### 12-Factor Scoring System

Each candidate receives a score based on:

| Factor                 | Points          | Description                                                   |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Genre Match**        | +30 per genre   | Matching genre from your top genres (weighted by frequency)   |
| **Genre Drift**        | -25             | No genre overlap when you have ‚â•3 top genres                  |
| **Tempo/BPM Match**    | +15 / +8 / -5   | Within 15 BPM (+15), 30 BPM (+8), or >60 BPM (-5)             |
| **Time-of-Day**        | +12 / +6        | Energy matches time of day (optimal +12, acceptable +6)       |
| **Popularity**         | +10 / -5 / -3   | Sweet spot 50-85 (+10), obscure <25 (-5), overplayed >95 (-3) |
| **Mood Progression**   | +12 / +8        | Continues valence trend (+12) or maintains stability (+8)     |
| **Energy Arc**         | +15 / +10       | Continues energy trend (+15) or maintains plateau (+10)       |
| **Artist Familiarity** | +5 per play     | How often you've played this artist                           |
| **Duration Match**     | +10 / +5 / -5   | Within 20% (+10), 40% (+5), or >40% (-5) of average           |
| **Source Quality**     | +30 / +15 / +10 | Spotify (+30), YouTube Mix (+15), Search (+10)                |
| **Smart Diversity**    | +20 / -5 to -40 | Context-aware: vibe match reduces penalty, consecutive -40    |
| **Skip Learning**      | -20 per skip    | Artist you've skipped recently (30min window)                 |
| **Genre Skip**         | -15 per skip    | Genre you've skipped recently                                 |
| **Duplicate**          | -1000           | Already played in last 100 tracks (ID + title/artist match)   |

#### Time-of-Day Energy Factors

| Time Period          | Energy Factor | Preference      |
| -------------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Morning (6am-12pm)   | 0.6           | Moderate energy |
| Afternoon (12pm-6pm) | 0.75          | High energy     |
| Evening (6pm-10pm)   | 0.65          | Moderate energy |
| Night (10pm-6am)     | 0.4           | Low energy      |

#### Trend Detection

**Energy Trend** (last 5 tracks):

- Calculates average energy of first half vs. second half
- **Increasing**: Difference > 0.1 ‚Üí Prefers higher energy
- **Decreasing**: Difference < -0.1 ‚Üí Prefers lower energy
- **Stable**: Difference between -0.1 and 0.1 ‚Üí Maintains current level

**Mood Trend (Valence)** (last 5 tracks):

- Calculates average valence of first half vs. second half
- **Increasing**: Difference > 0.1 ‚Üí Prefers happier/more positive tracks
- **Decreasing**: Difference < -0.1 ‚Üí Prefers mellower/introspective tracks
- **Stable**: Difference between -0.1 and 0.1 ‚Üí Maintains current mood

#### Caching & Performance

- **Genre cache**: Stores genre information for tracks to avoid redundant API calls
- **Audio features cache**: Maps YouTube identifier ‚Üí {genres, features, releaseYear}
- **Session tracking**: Monitors session start time for long-session adjustments
- **Skip history**: 30-minute memory window with genre tracking
- Persists in memory during bot runtime (cleared on restart)

#### Data Persistence

- **Autoplay state**: Stored in `helpers/data/guildState.json` per guild
- **Playback history**: Last 20 tracks in memory (used for profiling)
- **Skip patterns**: In-memory Map with 30-minute expiry, includes genres
- **Genre cache**: In-memory Map (cleared on restart)
- **Session start time**: In-memory Map for long-session detection

#### Detailed Logging

Enhanced logging provides full transparency:

- Top candidate with complete scoring breakdown
- Tempo, energy, genres, popularity for winner
- Individual scoring factors with point values
- Energy/mood trends and time-of-day adjustments
- Session profile summary (top genres, avg tempo, avg year, trends)

Example log output:

```
Session profile built: tracks=15, topGenres=rock(5), indie rock(4), alternative(3),
avgTempo=128BPM, avgYear=2015, energyTrend=increasing, timeOfDay=afternoon

Top candidates scored: winner=Arctic Monkeys - Do I Wanna Know? (167)
scoring=source:+30, genre:+60, tempo:+15, energyArc:+15, timeOfDay:+12,
popularity:+10, diversity:+20, artist:+5
```

### Testing

Run the autoplay test suite:

```bash
pnpm test:autoplay
```

Tests cover session profiling, genre scoring, tempo matching, duplicate detection, artist weight calculation, and edge cases.

## DJ Mode Overview

**DJ mode** restricts playback controls to users with a designated DJ role. Regular users can submit track suggestions that require DJ approval.

### Configuration

1. **Enable DJ mode:**

   ```
   /dj enable role:@DJ skipmode:hybrid threshold:50
   ```

2. **How it works:**

   - Users with the DJ role have full control
   - Non-DJs use `/play` to submit suggestions (appear in `/queue`)
   - DJ can approve/reject suggestions via buttons
   - Skip behavior depends on skip mode:
     - **dj**: Only DJ can skip
     - **vote**: Vote-based skip (50% threshold by default)
     - **hybrid**: Voting system, but DJ can override instantly

3. **Strict mode:**
   - `strict:true`: Only DJ role can manage DJ settings
   - `strict:false`: Server admins can also configure DJ mode

---

## Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't come online

- Check Docker logs: `docker compose logs -f bot`
- Verify `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `CLIENT_ID` in `.env.prod`
- Ensure bot has been invited with `applications.commands` scope

### Slash commands don't appear

- Run `pnpm deploy:prod` to register commands
- Wait up to 1 hour for global commands to propagate
- For instant updates, use guild-specific deployment

### Lavalink connection fails

- Check Lavalink logs: `docker compose logs -f lavalink`
- Verify `LAVALINK_HOST=lavalink` in `.env.prod` (for Docker)
- Ensure health check passes: `docker compose ps`

### Music playback issues

- Verify Lavalink is healthy and connected
- Check for age-restricted content (requires YouTube tokens)
- Review bot logs for fallback attempts
- Ensure Spotify credentials are configured for best autoplay results
- Check Lavalink node status and logs if playback fails

---

## üîß Reliability & Stability

### Voice Region Reconnection

When Discord changes the voice channel region (moving to a different voice server), the bot automatically:

- Detects the region change via `channelUpdate` event
- Saves complete playback state (track, position, queue, volume, loop mode)
- Destroys old connection and creates a fresh one to the new region
- Restores all settings and resumes playback from the exact position
- **No interruption** to the listening experience

---

## Troubleshooting

### Autoplay not working or genre drifting

- Ensure `/autoplay` is enabled (check now-playing message)
- **Verify Spotify credentials** in `.env` ‚Äî required for genre-aware recommendations
- Check logs for "Starting smart autoplay" and "Session profile built" messages
- Look for "topGenres" in logs to confirm genre detection
- Autoplay only triggers when queue is completely empty
- Without Spotify: Falls back to YouTube Mix (no genre/tempo/mood awareness)

### EQ or custom presets not saving

- Check for "Failed to save" errors in logs
- Ensure `helpers/data/` directory exists and is writable
- Verify no BigInt serialization errors (fixed in latest version)
- Check Docker volume mounts if using containers

### Data not persisting

- Ensure volume mounts in `docker-compose.yml`:
  ```yaml
  volumes:
    - ./helpers/data:/app/helpers/data
    - ./logs:/app/logs
  ```
- Check file permissions on host
